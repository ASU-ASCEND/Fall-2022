# Fall-2022
All relevant files and documents relating to the ASU ASCEND Fall 2022 mission

## What is ASCEND @ ASU?
ASCEND is a NASA Funded High altitude balloon Launch where students create a payload, collect data while airborne, and analyzed said data to present at the Arizona NASA Space Grant Symposium

## Meteorology Science Mission
The Meteorology Science Mission is responsible for calibrating new temperature and humidity sensors, writing MATLab code to calculate pressure levels and convert GPS data, and completing a sounding analysis. Time permitting, we want to automate soundings in real time and export our data from MATLAB to R to create plots.

The Spring semester will serve as an opportunity to complete research in the atmosphere, as all of our sensors from the Fall semesters will be easily reused. Currently plans are to study the vertical spatial distribution of precursors involved in the formation of surface level ozone and cloud condensation nuclei. Research will be conducted as if we were writing a paper to be published. Input from new members will be strongly considered when designing the timeline for the Spring semester.

## Electrical Subsystem
The electrical subsystem is responsible for connecting the sensors, microprocessors, and batteries properly powering and communicating with one another. These components will fit within the payloadâ€™s designated position simultaneously meeting weight requirements.

## Programming Subsystem
The sensors will be recording data and need to be programmed to work as intended. The programming subsystem will take charge of the software development side of getting the various sensors (GPS, Humidity, Temperature) to cooperate with other subsystems and science missions.

## Mechanical Subsystem
The mechanical subsystem is responsible for four (4) aspects: a comprehensive CAD model of the payload, the payload design, the construction of the payload, and  the organization of the parts and components within the payload.
