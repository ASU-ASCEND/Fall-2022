## Mechanical Subsystem
The mechanical subsystem is responsible for four (4) aspects: a comprehensive CAD model of the payload, the payload design, the construction of the payload, and  the organization of the parts and components within the payload.


## Electrical Subsystem
The electrical subsystem is responsible for connecting the sensors, microprocessors, and batteries properly powering and communicating with one another. These components will fit within the payloadâ€™s designated position simultaneously meeting weight requirements.


## Programming
The six sensors will be recording data and need to be programmed to work as intended. The programming subsystem will take charge of the software development side of getting the various sensors (pressure, humidity, temperature) to cooperate with three subsystems Radio, Electrical, and Meteorology.


## Radio
The radio subsystem is responsible for keeping a real time link between the payload and the ground station. The radio section on the payload consists of a LoRa module on the main board and a feedline coming from it to and external antenna(also assembled in the lab) located outside the payload. The ground station simply consists of an arduino connected to a computer to output the serial data and a feedline that leads to a directional yagi antenna which we can assemble in the lab.
